  ⚡ Streak ⚡ is a browser based reactive event stream library in the tradition of the
  <a href="http://reactivex.io/">ReactiveX</a> philosophy. Applications are created by composing
  event streams and Streak shines when used to coordinate multiple independent event streams. The
  library aims to simplify asynchronous programming and
  minimize the hazards of side effects and mutable shared state.
</p>

<p>
  The developer experience is a primary concern in Streak without sacrificing end-user experience. This
  means that extensive invariant checking occurs in development mode but is optimized away in production
  builds of the library. Streak is under heavy development, and sometimes the documentation does not keep
  up to date. The goal of the library is to be easy to use, and this includes clear and concise documentation.
  If something is unclear please <a href="https://github.com/realityforge/streak/issues">report it as a bug</a>
  because it <em>is</em> a bug. If a new user has a hard time, then we need to fix the problem.
</p>

<p>
  Streak was developed to be used within the browser. It is designed to be transpiled down to reasonably
  efficient javascript with a small code size. Often the library chose a smaller code size over a better
  runtime speed under the assumption that the browser speed is more likely to be negatively impacted by
  increased code size due to download time, js parse time and js compile time than it would be due to a
  slight runtime performance degradation although the {@link streak.Stream#compose(Function)} escape hatch has
  been added so that users can write their own operators when performance is critical.

<h3>Concepts</h3>

<h4>Events</h4>

<p>
  An event is an action or occurrence recognized by software that occurs at a particular instant in
  time. An event can be thought of as a pair containing a <code>value</code> element describing the event
  data and a <code>time</code> element that indicates the time at which the event is emitted. Both the value
  and time elements are just as important.
</p>

<p>
  An example of an event may be a network message. Another example is a user interaction such as a keypress
  or a mouse button click. An event could also be triggered by passing of time in a timer such that an event
  is generated every <code>N</code> milliseconds.
</p>

<h4>Streams</h4>

<p>
  A {@link streak.Stream stream} is a time-ordered sequence of events. For example, a stream of click
  events from a UI control or a stream of messages over a WebSocket. Operators filter, transform and combine
  input streams. An operator never modifies the input stream but instead creates a new stream.
</p>

<p>
  A listener or a {@link streak.Subscriber subscriber} in Streak parlance receives the events and reacts to events
  as they occur. The events are received in the order in which they are emitted and at the time they are emitted.
</p>

<p>
  A stream can also send other signals to the subscriber indicating that the stream has
  completed or that the stream has failed. If the subscriber receives these signals then they will not
  receive any more events from the stream and must handle that appropriately. Thus streams may be infinite,
  finite, or may fail.
</p>

<!--
A stream does not define an execution and in most cases could subscribe to the same stream multiple
times to get multiple executions. `"Subjects"` are the mechanism where a stream can control if new
execution data is created when subscriptions occur.
-->

<h3>Event Sources and Stream Operators</h3>

<p>
  The library includes construction methods to create event sources combined with a powerful set of operators
  for filtering, transforming and merging event streams. The construction methods and operators available are
  as follows:
