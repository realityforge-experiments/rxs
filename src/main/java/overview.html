  Streak is a reactive stream library in the <a href="http://reactivex.io/">ReactiveX</a> tradition
  where applications are created by composing event streams. Streak shines when used to coordinate
  multiple independent event streams. The library aims to simplify asynchronous programming and
  minimize the hazards of side effects and mutable shared state.
</p>
<p>
  The library includes construction methods to create event sources combined with a powerful set of operators
  for filtering, transforming and merging event streams. The construction methods and operators available are
  as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#construction">Construction</a>: Methods to construct an event stream.</li>
  <li><a href="#filtering">Filtering</a>: Operators that remove items from a stream based on some criteria.</li>
  <li><a href="#transformation">Transformation</a>: Operators that change the form of items and signals passing through the stream.</li>
</ul>
