### Unreleased

### [v0.04](https://github.com/spritz/spritz/tree/v0.04) (2019-03-12)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/spritz/spritz/compare/v0.03...v0.04)

* Convert `Subscription` from an interface to a class and move common behaviour out of `AbstractSubscription`
  and into new `Subscription` class.
* Introduce the concept of a `Hub` that is both an `EventEmitter` and a `Stream` except the types
  of items that the stream emits and the types of items put into `EventEmitter` need not be identical.
  Refactor `Subject` to extend `Hub` with the additional restriction that the types align.
* Expose `ConnectableStream.isConnected()` helper method.
* Expose `EventEmitter.isNotDone()` helper method.
* Expose `Scheduler.isVirtualProcessorUnitActivated()` helper method.
* Add `Stream.subscribe(EventEmitter)` that routes events from a stream to an `EventEmitter`.
* Add `Stream.webSocket(...)` method that creates a `Hub` that is responsible for managing bidrectional
  communication over a `WebSocket`.
* If `Subscription.cancel()` is invoked when a VPU is not active then activate VPU.
